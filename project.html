<h1>IT project</h1>
<h2>Name of ICT project:Create website</h2>  
 <h3>Introduce</h3>
 <p>When creating a web page, first determine the theme of the website, analyze the functions of the website, and reflect all the functions of the website in the document. Next, collect materials. Determine the modules required by the website through contact and communication with relevant personnel of the website, and reflect these modules in the document; collect relevant pictures, texts, videos and other materials. The next step is to plan the website, design the website, draw the home page interface diagram (sketch), and make the web page. Next, perform a local test, open index.html, and then browse all the web pages to check whether there is a right error (whether the content is complete, whether the interface is reasonable, and whether the link is correct). Finally, use the IP address to test the website. If there is no problem, the website test is successful.</p>
